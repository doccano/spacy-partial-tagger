# spacy-partial-tagger

This is a CRF tagger for partially annotated dataset in spaCy. The implementation of 
this tagger is based on Effland and Collins. (2021).

## Dataset

Prepare spaCy binary format file. This library expects tokenization is character-based.
For more detail about spaCy binary format, see [this page](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats#training).


## Training

```sh
python -m spacy train config.cfg --output outputs --paths.train train.spacy --paths.dev dev.spacy 
```

## Evaluation

```sh
python -m spacy evaluate outputs/model-best test.spacy
```

## Installation

```
pip install spacy-partial-tagger
```
