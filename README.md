# spacy-partial-tagger

This is a CRF tagger for partially annotated dataset in spaCy. You can build your 
own NER tagger only from dictionary. The algorithm of this tagger is based on Effland and Collins. (2021).


## Overview

## Dataset Preparation

Prepare spaCy binary format file. This library expects tokenization is character-based.
For more detail about spaCy binary format, see [this page](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats#training).

You can prepare your own dataset with [spaCy's entity ruler](https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching#entityruler) as follows:

```py
import spacy
from spacy.tokens import DocBin
from spacy_partial_tagger.tokenizer import CharacterTokenizer


nlp = spacy.blank("en")
nlp.tokenizer = CharacterTokenizer(nlp.vocab)  # Use a character-based tokenizer

patterns = [{"label": "LOC", "pattern": "Tokyo"}, {"label": "LOC", "pattern": "Japan"}]
ruler = nlp.add_pipe("entity_ruler")
ruler.add_patterns(patterns)

doc = nlp("Tokyo is the capital of Japan.")

doc_bin = DocBin()
doc_bin.add(doc)

doc_bin.to_disk("/path/to/data.spacy")
```

## Training

Train your model as follows:

```sh
python -m spacy train config.cfg --output outputs --paths.train /path/to/train.spacy --paths.dev /path/to/dev.spacy --gpu-id 0
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate your model as follows:

```sh
python -m spacy evaluate outputs/model-best /path/to/test.spacy --gpu-id 0
```

## Installation

```sh
pip install spacy-partial-tagger
```
